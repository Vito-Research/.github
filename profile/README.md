Vito is creating software that uses vitals to detect infection in realtime.  Studies show Covid-19 may be detectable days prior to infection using data commonly found on smartwatches.  While research exists, an easy to use app does not.

### Vito has one goal...

1. Reduce the spread of Covid-19

### How?

1. Stress Event Alerts - Receive stress alerts that may be due to infection and take what actions you deem appropriate
2. Background Processing - Open the app once, give us health and notification permissions, then the app works in the background and will send a notification if there is a change in physiological markers
3. Encourage Trust - Built with the community and progressive privacy standards

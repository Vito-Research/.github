### **Why Vito?**

Andreas envisions a time where people like his Aunt who died from Covid-19 may be less prone to infection due to data driven insights.  Vito is an app and research study developed by a group of students to analyze the relationship between infection and smartwatch data to encourage further precautions against infection.

### **What Are We Solving?**

Covid-19 hits immunocompromised individuals the hardest:

- Family members surrounding people with an immunocompromised immune system want to reduce the chances of infection spreading to their loved one, Vito may encourage greater precautions while interacting with immunocompromised individuals driven by data.

Covid-19 is unpredictable:

- Individuals may experience varying levels of severity of infection of Covid-19 and may wreak havoc at any moment, Vito hopes to encourage further precautions when the likelihood of infection increases.

Covid-19 testing is in short supply during waves:

- Covid-19 waves pose stress on our healthcare system, with testing accessibility decreasing, Vito may be a tool to prioritize testing for individuals with a higher likelihood of infection.

### **What's Our Approach?**

Physiological Data Derived from Smartwatches:

- Heart Rate - Research suggests heart rate increases during infection
- Respiration Rate - Research suggests respiration rate increases during infection
- Blood Oxygen - Research suggests respiration rate decreases during infection
- Heart Rate Variability - Research suggests heart rate variability decreases during infection

Environmental Factors:

- Environmental Audio Exposure -  Hypothesized to measure occurrences of more densely populated areas without location or microphone access
- Rate of Hand Washing Events - Known to decrease the chances of infection, hand washing is key to estimating probability of infection
- Regional Rate of Covid-19 Transmission - Areas with higher Covid-19 cases increase the likelihood of infection

Deterministic Finite State Machine:

- A level based system to quantify chances of infection based on the above data types

Machine Learning:

- In development
